A session ID needs to be passed as a query parameter to each endpoint so the PM can do an access check in the PDP. Requests The exposed web services act as an administrative Policy Enforcement Point (PEP). When a request comes in the PEP forwards the request to the PDP, which ensures the requesting user is allowed to carry out the action. This means the PEP always needs to know which user is sending a request. This is tracked using session IDs that represent users who have authenticated successfully with the server. Every endpoint requires this session ID to determine the user. The only API that does not require a session ID is the Sessions API. This API is used to authenticate users and provides the session IDs that will be used in subsequent requests to the Policy Machine. For example, to sign in as the super user: POST /pm/api/sessions Content-Type:application/json { \"username\": \"super\", \"password\": \"super\" } The response from the server will look like: { \"code\": 9000, \"message\": \"success\", \"entity\": \"NEW_SESSION_ID\" } Now the user can pass this session ID to the server for any other calls to the API. Responses A response from the Policy Machine will always return an HTTP status code of 200, with more details provided in the body of the response. For example: { \"code\": 9000, \"message\": \"success\", \"entity\": \"return value of the API call\" } Response codes code type description 9000 success the request was successful 6000 error unexpected error 6001 error there was an error with the graph 6003 error the user did not have permission to carry out the action 6004 error there was an error authenticating a user 6005 error there was an error with a prohibition 6006 error there was an error accessing the database 6007 error error with the PM configuration Sessions API Create session Authenticate the provided credentials and return a session ID if successfully authenticated. Endpoint POST /pm/api/sessions Parameters Parameter Required Location Description username required body The username of the user password required body The password of the user Example request $ curl -X POST {host}:{port}/pm/api/sessions Example request body { \"username\": \"super\", \"password\": \"super\" } Example response { \"code\": 9000, \"message\": \"success\", \"entity\": \"{sessionID}\" } Delete session Delete the session with the given session ID. Endpoint DELETE /pm/api/sessions/{sessionID} Example request $ curl -X DELETE {host}:{port}/pm/api/sessions/{sessionID} Example response { \"code\": 9000, \"message\": \"session deleted\", \"entity\": \"null\" } Get session user Get the ID of the user that corresponds with the provided session ID. Endpoint GET /pm/api/sessions/{sessionID} Example request $ curl {host}:{port}/pm/api/sessions/{sessionID} Example response { \"code\": 9000, \"message\": \"success\", \"entity\": 1234 } Graph API Get nodes Retrieve nodes from the graph. Use query parameters to filter nodes based on name, type, or any other properties nodes may have.

Endpoint GET /pm/api/graph/nodes Parameters Parameter Required Location Description session true query The ID of the current session. name false query The name of the nodes to search for. type false query The type of the nodes to search for. Important Notes The name and type query parameters are the only preset parameters to search for. It is possible to search for nodes with any property key value pair by including the pair in the query parameters of the request. For example, ?key1=value1&key2=value2 . Only nodes that match every provided property will be returned. To search for all nodes that have a specfic property key but an arbitrary value use the wildcard * . For example, key3=* . Example request $ curl {host}:{port}/pm/api/graph/nodes?session={sessionID}&type=OA Example response { \"code\": 9000, \"message\": \"success\", \"entity\": [ { \"name\": \"node1\", \"type\": \"OA\", \"properties\": { \"key1\": \"value1\" } }, { \"name\": \"node2\", \"type\": \"OA\", \"properties\": { \"key2\": \"value2\" } } ] } Create node Create a new node in the NGAC graph with the provided name, type, and properties. When creating a policy class, leave the baseID parameter empty, as it will be ignored.

This API also acts as a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) by ensuring any calling user has permission to carry out a command before any action is taken. Exposing the PEP allows users to create web-based, NGAC aware applications. Important Notes Namespaces - Node's can belong to namespaces which allow for multiple nodes of the same type to have the same name. Nodes that have the same name but different type are allowed in the same namesapce. If a node is created with out specifying the namespace, it will be put in the 'default' namespace. Super user metadata - There are 7 nodes that make up the super user metadata. The super user is assigned to 2 user attributes super_ua1 and super_ua2. These two attributes are assigned to a policy class also called super. Super_ua1 is associated with an Object Attribute, super_oa1, which is also assigned to the policy class super, with * permissions. This gives any user in super_ua1 all permissions on objects in super_oa1. There is one Object called super assigned to super_oa1. Super_ua2 is associated with super_ua1 with * permissions. This allows the super user to have all permissions on itself as well. Creating a policy class - When creating a policy class we check if the requesting user has the permission \"create a policy class\" on the super object. Policy class assignments - When a policy class is created, an Object Attribute that will represent the policy class is also created, and assigned to super_oa1. The representative will be used any time a user is assigning to or deassigning from the policy class. This allows us to control who can perform these actions since policy classes them selves cannot be assigned or associated to any other nodes. Run with Docker-compose Build the war file by running mvn clean package install from the project root. This will create pm.war in the project's /target/ directory.

Common Elements First, some common elements that will be used throughout this specification. user user: name: properties: func_...: Specifies a User with the given name and properties. It is possible to specify a group of users that share a property by omitting the name field and adding a property that they share. A function can be used to specify a user so long as the function returns a user or set of users. Example: user: name: \"aUser\" user: # all users who have the property key=sharedProperty properties: key: \"sharedProperty\" ### user: func_current_user: user_attribute user_attribute: name: properties: func_...: Specifies a user attribute with the given name and properties. If multiple user attributes share a name, then this element will represent all of those user attributes at processing time. Use the properties field to differentiate user attributes with the same name. A function can be used to specify a user_attribute so long as the function returns a user attribute or a set of user attributes. Example: user_attribute: name: \"uaName\" properties: key: \"value\" ### user_attribute: func_uattrs_of_current_user: function A function refers to a previously defined function that is supported by the Policy Machine Event Processing Point (EPP). A list of valid functions, as well as tutorial on how to add functions can be found here . Every function must have the prefix func_ this will allow the parser to know it's found a function, and to look for a way to parse it. Example func_FUNCTION_NAME: - arg1_name: \"foo\" - arg2_name: func_ANOTHER_FUNCTION: - arg3_name: user_attribute: name: \"uaName\" Event Pattern event: subject: policy_class: operations: target: The Event Pattern specifies an event involving the policy elements of the Policy Machine. An example is a user performing a read operation on an object. This is called an access event, which is the primary focus of obligations as described in the NGAC standard. An access event has four components: The subject, policy class, operations, and target. All of these are optional, but omitting them will have different consequences, which will be described in the sections below. While the Policy Machine focuses on access events, it is possible to extend the functionality of the Event Pattern to other events such as time. The section How to Extend the Event Pattern section provides a tutorial on how this is possible with the Policy Machine. Subject subject: user: any_user: process: The subject specification can be a user, any user, any user from a set of users and/or user attributes, or a process. If the subject is omitted than all events will match this component of an access event. user See user any_user - user: - user_attribute: - func_...: If left empty, this event pattern will match any user. The any_user element also accepts an array of user , user_attribute , and func_... . Example: any_user: # any user ### any_user: # any user in UAttr123 and user123 - user_attribute: name: \"UAttr123\" properties: key: \"value\" - user: name: \"user123\" ### any_user: func_a_function: # a function that returns a set of entities process process: # can be a string value fun...: # or it can be a function A process is optional, and if omitted than it will be ignored. A process can be a string value (ex: 'a_process_id') or it an be a function such as func_current_process . If the process element is present but is empty than any process will match this pattern. Example: process: \"a_process_id\" # pattern matches the process with \"a_process_id\" as it's ID. ### process: # any event with a process ID present ### process: func_current_process: policy class policy_class: name: any: each: The policy class specification can specify a particular policy class with a given name, any policy class, any policy class from a set, all policy classes from a set, or all policy classes. Example policy_class: # policy class PC1 name: \"PC1\" ### policy_class: # any policy class any: ### policy_class: # PC1 or PC2 any: - \"PC1\" - \"PC2\" ### policy_class: # PC1 and PC2 each: - \"PC1\" - \"PC2\" ### policy_class: # all policy classes Operations operations: - \"operation_name\" The operations specification is just a string array of operation names. If the array is not empty than any event with any of the listed operations will match this component of the pattern. If the array is empty than any operation will match this pattern. Example: operations: - \"read\" - \"write\" Target target: policy_element: - policy_element: in: The target specification can be a specific policy element, any policy element, any policy element that is contained in other policy elements, or any policy element from a set of policy elements. All of these elements are optional, and if all are omitted then any event will match this component of the pattern. There are two means by which to express the target of an event. The first is by using policy_element and in to express the target policy element(s) and optionally which containers they are assigned to. The second us by using an array of policy_element . In this case an event will match this component of the pattern if the target of the event exists in the array of policy elements. Mixing these two cases will cause a parsing error. Policy Element policy_element: name: type: properties: A policy element can be a user, user attribute, object, or object attribute. If more than one policy element matches the given parameters, than the policy element component will be a set of elements. If the element is empty, then any element will match this component of the target specification. In in: any: - policy_element: each: - policy_element: The in clause of the policy element specification accepts any or each . Both accept arrays, and will match an event if the target specification policy element is in any/each of the listed policy elements. Examples # any example target: # same as saying \"any element that is assigned to pe1 and/or pe2\" policy_element: # any policy element in: # the policy_element is in pe1 AND/OR pe2 any: - policy_element: name: \"pe1\" type: \"OA\" - policy_element: name: \"pe2\" type: \"OA\" ### # each example target: # same as saying \"any element that is assigned to pe1 and pe2\"\" policy_element: # any policy element in: # the policy element is in pe1 AND pe2 each: - policy_element: name: \"pe1\" type: \"OA\" - policy_element: name: \"pe2\" type: \"OA\" ### # array example target: # same as saying \"pe1 or pe2\" - policy_element: name: \"pe1\" - policy_element: name: \"pe2\" Functions Predefined Functions current_user current_process How to add a function How to Extend the Event Pattern","title":"1.
